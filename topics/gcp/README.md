## 🚀 Getting Started with AI

### Ask Copilot for Help

**Example prompts to start learning:**

```
"Explain the difference between Compute Engine, App Engine, and Cloud Run"

"Show me how to create a Cloud Storage bucket using Python SDK"

"What are the best practices for organizing GCP resources?"

"Create a Terraform script to deploy a simple web app on Cloud Run"

"Explain GCP IAM roles and how to implement least privilege"
```

## 📁 Directory Structure

Create subdirectories as you learn:

```
gcp/
├── compute/           # Compute services examples
├── storage/           # Storage examples
├── networking/        # Network configurations
├── iam/              # IAM policies and examples
├── terraform/        # Infrastructure as Code
├── data-analytics/   # BigQuery, Dataflow, etc.
├── ai-ml/            # AI/ML service examples
└── projects/         # Complete project implementations
```

## 💡 Project Ideas

1. **Serverless API**: Build a REST API using Cloud Functions and Cloud Run
2. **Data Pipeline**: Create an ETL pipeline with Pub/Sub, Dataflow, and BigQuery
3. **ML Model Deployment**: Train and deploy a model using Vertex AI
4. **Static Website**: Host a website using Cloud Storage and Cloud CDN
5. **Microservices on GKE**: Deploy a multi-service application on Kubernetes
